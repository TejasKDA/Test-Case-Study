## General Information
- The Lending  company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of 
  medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.
- Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called 
  credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the 
  money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the 
  customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 
- If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of 
  credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
- loan.csv is used for the project


## Conclusions
-Loans with an interest rate exceeding 12% are more likely to be charged off compared to lower interest rate categories.

-Individuals without home ownership are at a higher risk of loan default.

-Applicants seeking loans for Renewable Energy and Small Business purposes have an elevated likelihood of defaulting.

-Elevated Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratios pose a greater risk of defaults, as they may be linked to lower annual incomes.

-A higher count of bankruptcies is associated with an increased probability of loan defaults.

-Loans classified under Grade G have the highest likelihood of default among different loan grades
